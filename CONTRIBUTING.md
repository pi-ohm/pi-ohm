## Welcome

Thank you for your interest in contributing!

See the development portion of the main README.md for more info on development.

If you are vibe coding and do not have any sort of pre-push/commit hooks, it's recommended that you install and use ours via [lefthook](./lefthook.yml), or by running `yarn hooksinstall`.

## Prompt requests

If you are a noob to OSS, please don't spam PRs. Create an issue with the tag `prompt-request`, and outline in detail what you want. Contributors should be able to copy and paste this into a coding agent without too much friction.

## Pull requests

Please ask your agent to review your PR before submitting it. If you don't understand the code that it wrote, consider opening an issue with a prompt request.
