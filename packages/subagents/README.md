# @pi-ohm/subagents

Install only subagent support for Pi (delegated + primary-tool profiles).

```bash
pi install npm:@pi-ohm/subagents
```

Scaffolded subagents:

- `librarian` — multi-repo code understanding (default: primary-tool profile)
- `oracle` — reasoning-heavy advisor/reviewer
- `finder` — intelligent behavior-based search
- `task` — isolated parallel execution worker
- `painter` — explicit-request image generation/editing helper

Profiles can be marked with `primary: true` in config/catalog to indicate direct
invocation as a top-level tool entrypoint instead of delegated-only invocation.

Commands:

- `/ohm-subagents`
- `/ohm-subagent <id>`
